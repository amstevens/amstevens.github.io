              ABOUT STEELSERIES ENGINE
            </p>
            <p class="lede">
              SteelSeries Engine 3, our software for supporting our peripherals, has been around now for over 5 years. In the beginning of 2017, I was brought on part time (most of my time is spent on the digital team) to help support the software team in a UX role. <strong>Although most of our work together is under NDA I'd love to discuss in person the unique problems I've faced with this team</strong>. In the mean time, I can show off public work and prototypes I helped them create.

              One of the most challenging aspects my work with Engine, is slowly introducing
              improvements to the UI without breaking the conventions of the existing system. With the release of the Apex M750 keyboard, we knew our previous illumination UI needed to be revisited.
            </p>
            <p class="step-body">
               The existing UI was meaningless to users who had no image editing experience. The revised UI featured labels for each tool, a default to the most commonly used tools, and more obvious redo/undo buttons. I prototyped the new UI's behavior which you can view below.
